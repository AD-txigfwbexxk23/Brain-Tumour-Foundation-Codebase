## üè• Usage Guide

### For Medical Professionals

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Start the Streamlit app using the command above
   - Wait for the model to load (you'll see a success message)

2. **Enter Patient Data**
   - Use the sidebar to input all required patient parameters
   - The system provides helpful tooltips for each field
   - Input validation ensures data quality

3. **Generate Predictions**
   - Click "Generate Prediction" to analyze the patient data
   - Review the survival rate prediction and treatment recommendation
   - Examine the risk assessment and treatment probability breakdown

4. **Interpret Results**
   - **Survival Rate**: Percentage probability of patient survival
   - **Treatment Recommendation**: AI-suggested optimal treatment approach
   - **Confidence Levels**: Statistical confidence in the recommendations
   - **Risk Stratification**: Automated risk level assessment

### Understanding the Output

#### Survival Rate Prediction
- Displayed as a percentage (0-100%)
- Based on the trained model's analysis of patient factors
- Higher percentages indicate better prognosis

#### Treatment Recommendations
- **None**: Conservative monitoring approach
- **Chemotherapy**: Drug-based treatment
- **Radiation**: Radiation therapy
- **Surgery**: Surgical intervention

#### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk** (<30% survival): Immediate specialist consultation recommended
- **Moderate Risk** (30-60% survival): Regular monitoring and follow-up
- **Lower Risk** (>60% survival): Continue with recommended treatment plan

## üîß Technical Architecture
